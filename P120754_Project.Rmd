### About Cocoa Beans


The beans which have been derived from the Cocoa tree are called Cocoa beans. 

The other common names for Cocoa bean are Cocoa, Cacao and Cacao bean.

It is the key ingredients of making chocolate.

Cocoa is loaded with antioxidants to provide anti-aging properties and high concentration of Epicatechin that is helpful for cardiovascular health. 

Largest exporters of Cocoa beans: Ghana, Cote dâ€™Ivoire, Ecuador, Nigeria and Cameroon

Main importers of Cocoa beans: United States, Netherlands, Belgium-Luxembourg and Malaysia

General:

The storyboard is about the trend of cocoa production in worldwide, 
the nutrition facts of chocolate types and products with chocolate. 

The next visualizations are about chocolate bars in the world. 
The content is related to the number of ingredients, cocoa percentage, 
ratings and characteristics of chocolate bars.

Malaysia:

The frames are about export, import and the production of cocoa beans.

***
- The worldwide production of cocoa beans were recorded from 1961 to 2021. 
The data collected consist of Official figure, Unofficial figure, 
Estimated value, Imputed value and even Missing value due to data cannot exist or not applicable.

- The line of total production shows fluctuation throughout the years 
but the trend shows an increasing pattern.

***
- The common types of chocolate in the market are Dark Chocolate with 40% of Cocoa, 
Dark Chocolate with 70% of Cocoa, Milk Chocolate and White Chocolate. 
Their nutritional values are always being compared by people.

- The bar chart illustrates the values of nutritional value for each chocolate type.

- Example: In 100g of Dark Chocolate with 40% of Cocoa, 
there is only 498kcal of Energy which is the lowest among the four.

***
- The colour of a point is determined by the number of ingredients in the chocolate bar.
Each point, representing one type of chocolate bar, will show the percentage of cocoa, 
the ratings and the number of ingredients when hover.

- The distribution is denser at the range from 60% to 85% of cocoa percentage with the ratings 
ranged from 2.00 to 4.00 despite the number of ingredients in the chocolate bars.

- To check on the cocoa percentage together with the ratings for a specific of number of ingredients, 
click at the legend to hide the undesired number and get a clearer view.

- Example: With 1 ingredient which is definitely cocoa only, the percentage is 100% for all chocolate bars. 
The ratings for these dark chocolates are 2.50, 2.75, 3.00 and 3.50 as shown in the plot.

***
- The words shown in the figure is the most memorable characteristics of 
chocolate bars made from the cocoa beans from the selected country of origin. 
Terms generally relate to anything from texture, flavor, overall opinion, etc.

- Darker font color and bigger font size indicates the word is highly used to
describe the bars as compared to others.

- Example: For chocolate bars made from the cocoa beans from Colombia, 
the most frequent words used to describe the characteristics are 
"marshmallow" (16 times), "nutty" (16 times), "sweet" (13 times) and "fruit" (9 times).

***
- The statistics of regional production of cocoa beans are shown in the figure. 
The production value in 2022 is the estimated value.

- The production increased from 1980 and reached its highest point 
at the total production of 80,800 tonne in 1990.
The amount dropped since then and currently getting lower which was not more than 500 tonne in 2022.

- Sabah contributed the most in the total production as compared to West Malaysia and Sarawak.

### Conclusion

- The increase in worldwide production of cocoa beans allows 
more type of chocolate bars and products to be introduced to the market.

- In general, people still prefer the percentage of cocoa between 60% to 85% 
and chocolate bars with two or three main ingredients. 
Not too pure for bitterness but not too sweet as well.

- Due to the decrease in cocoa plantation, the import is always higher than the export in Malaysia.

- This situation indicates that Malaysia is spending more for imports of cocoa beans than the gains from exports.
